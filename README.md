Repo for - Word Guess Game (JS Homework)

The Word Guess Game has a Texas theme.

I started by doing the pseudocode and working towards the html. I got the game to work with alerts but I got tripped up getting the results to display in my html page. Even though I was using getElementById, I think I got my var names out of sync.

I also did not add the if/else for when a user does not correctly guess the letters within the allotted "guesses"; this is counted as a Loss. Currently the game proceeds until the user guesses the word.
